- 'init' and 'clone' are one-time operations
- it's good to create a '~/git' folder for all your repositories
- 'git push origin name': sends the 'main'code from your computer to the rmemote, 'origin' 
- 'git pull origin main': bring down the 'main' branch from the remote 'origin' 

- 'git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME': the "older" way you will see the 'git switch' command
